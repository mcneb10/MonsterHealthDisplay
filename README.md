# MonsterHealthDisplay
This is a mutator for UT99 that shows the health of the Pawn, Decoration, or other object that health can be read from. It also shows the name of the object and the object's target.

# How to build
Place this repo in the `Unreal Tournament` folder and run `umake` to build. The `.u` file should be put into `System` automatically. `MonsterHealthDisplay.int` must also be copied into `System` for the mod to load.
